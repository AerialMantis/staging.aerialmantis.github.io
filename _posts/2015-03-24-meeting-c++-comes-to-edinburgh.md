On the 17th of March I attended the first meeting of C\+\+ Edinburgh, a new Edinburgh based user group of Meeting C\+\+. [Meeting C++][meeting-cpp-website] is an independent C\+\+ conference that has user groups all over the world, that arrange regular mini-conferences and events.

C\+\+ Edinburgh has been organised by [Joseph Mansfield][joe-twitter], with the aim of bringing local C\+\+ developers and enthusiasts together to discuss ideas and share knowledge. The new user group is off to a great start with 33 people attending the first meeting that consisted of talks by Joseph and myself on the relevance of C\+\+ and an introduction to features of the C\+\+11 standard. The user group is sponsored by [Codeplay Software][codeplay-website] and [Toshiba Medical][toshiba-website], two local software companies that are heavily involved in C\+\+ development.

The aim of the first meeting to introduce the new user group and to gage the level of interest, the format for future meetings is still being decided and largely depends on the level of interest and availability of presenters.

The meetings are open to anyone who is interested, whether that be professionally or personally, even if you are completely new to C\+\+ and would simply like to learn more about it. For more information about the user group and upcoming events or if you are interested in presenting at a meeting you can checkout the [website][cpp-edinburgh-website], follow on [twitter][cpp-edinburgh-twitter], or join the [mailing list][cpp-edinburgh-mailing-list].
